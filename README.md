# AI_based_car_parking_using_open_CV
**1. Project Title**
AI-Based Car Parking System Using OpenCV

**2. Project Description**
Provide a brief overview of the project, including:

**The purpose of the system.**
How AI and OpenCV are used to detect and manage parking spaces.
The key features of the project.
**Example:**

This project is an AI-based car parking management system that utilizes OpenCV for real-time parking slot detection. Using image processing techniques, the system identifies available parking spaces and displays their status. This helps in efficient parking space utilization and reduces manual efforts in parking management.

**3. Features**
List out the main features of your system:

Real-time parking slot detection using OpenCV.
Automatic vacancy detection and slot marking.
Image processing for detecting parked vehicles.
Can be integrated with CCTV camera feeds.
User-friendly visualization of parking status.
**4. Technologies Used**
Mention the tech stack and libraries used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Frameworks:
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
TensorFlow/Keras (if using AI for car detection)
**5. Installation & Setup**
